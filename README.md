Arduino Utilities to manage FortiThing IoT device

This is basically a class to simplify usage of FortiThing: 

- Reading values such as temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.
- Setting values for leds, RGBs, etc
- Publishing the information in a MQTT server
- Subscribing to changes in MQTT server

Check 'fortithing.ino' for an illustrative example.

You don't have to worry about internals of FortiThing.[h|cpp].

Enjoy!
